Plan:

I already have some JavaScript references bookmarked, so I'll start by looking at those to see if they have information about jQuery.  If not, I'll do a Google search for more resources.

To learn, I'll read the resources and then try to implement some of the commands in a simple web page to see how they work.

Since this is a short project, I'll probably take breaks only if I get confused or frustrated.
